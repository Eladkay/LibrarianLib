/**
 * Tracks (most often GL) resources and their associated objects, calling release functions after they have been GC'd.
 * The amount of time between the object being garbage collected and the release function is indeterminate, possibly
 * requiring multiple GC cycles.
 */
object GlResourceGc {
    /**
     * Starts tracking the given object, calling the [releaseFunction] on the main thread at some point after [obj] is
     * garbage collected.
     *
     * The passed function _MUST NOT_ capture the tracked object. Doing so would lead to a circular reference and the
     * resource will leak. If you need any fields from the tracked object, put the values in variables outside the
     * function and use those.
     *
     * To help with this, the returned resource object can hold some mutable state which will be passed to the release
     * function.
     *
     * Bad:
     * ```java
     * public class MyGlThing {
     *     private int glHandle;
     *     public MyGlThing() {
     *         GlResourceGc.track(this, () -> {
     *             GlXX.glDeleteXX(this.glHandle); // `this` is captured here so we can access the `glHandle` field,
     *                                             // so this resource will never be released.
     *         });
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     * Good:
     * ```java
     * public class MyGlThing {
     *     private GlResourceGc.Resource<Integer> glHandle;
     *     public MyGlThing() {
     *         this.glHandle = GlResourceGc.track(this, 10, (Integer state) -> {
     *             GlXX.glDeleteXX(state);
     *         });
     *
     *         // later in the code...
     *         this.glHandle.setState(100);
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
