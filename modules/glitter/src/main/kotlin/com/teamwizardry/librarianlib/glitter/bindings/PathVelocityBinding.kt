/**
 * A 3D binding that reads tangent values from a ParticlePath.
 *
 * By default the path is traversed from 0-1 across the lifetime of the particle, however using [timescale] and [offset]
 * this timing can be adjusted. The timing equation is: `pathFraction = (age/lifetime + offset) * timescale % 1`, where
 * [timescale] and [offset] are replaced with 1 and 0 respectively if they are null
 *
 * Once the time is determined, the tangent returned from the passed path will be multiplied by [speed], allowing paths
 * to be moved within the world
