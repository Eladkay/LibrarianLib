/**
 * Bindings are essentially accessors for some abstract data, whether that is stored persistently in the particle,
 * returned from a constant value, or computed on the fly.
 *
 * While it would be easy to store information about particles in fields as [Vec3d]s, [Color]s, and any number of other
 * objects, doing so is slow and incurs a major memory burden, especially the immutable [Vec3d], which must be
 * reallocated every time it is modified, causing an astronomical amount of memory churn. One solution to this problem
 * is to store the state of particles in a raw double array, which eliminates the performance penalty of constantly
 * allocating [Vec3d]s and other short-lived objects, as well as the JVM overhead of simply storing those objects.
 * While one method of using this array would be to simply pass indices around, [ParticleBinding]s provide a much more
 * flexible interface.
 *
 * One of the major upsides of bindings is that they don't necessarily have to be tied directly to the particle array,
 * or have anything to do with the specific particle at all. While the most common binding, [StoredBinding], is directly
 * tied into the particle array, other binding implementations dynamically compute their values or even return a static
 * value that has nothing to do with the particle in question.
